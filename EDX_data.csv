Healthy Ageing in 6 Steps. Let your environment do the work.,https://www.edx.org/course/healthy-ageing-6-steps-let-environment-delftx-eit001x-0,"Learn how to make healthy choices and adjustments to your lifestyle and environment to help you live a healthier, happier and longer life.","Many health complaints, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or joint problems seem inescapable diseases of old-age, but originate mostly from our lifestyle. A lifestyle that is largely dictated by our environment. The mismatch between our 'old' genes - our evolutionary heritage - and the 'modern' environment is the reason that we cannot resist the constant stimuli that seduce us to make unhealthy choices. Do's and don'ts cannot help us. 
This health course will take a radically different approach to showing you how to secure a lifestyle, which will keep you healthy throughout the lifespan. We have to let the environment do the work for us. By making small changes at our home, work, school or neighbourhood, healthier choices can become easier and automated.
Practical assignments will give you the skills to re-design your daily environments to promote healthy, longer lives for you and your family, colleagues and neighbours with whom you share your re-designed environments. You will learn how to create your own healthy living zone!
We will take you on excursions to Copenhagen, Denmark and to Ghent, Belgium to show you hands-on how the environment can help you live longer, healthier and happier lives!

Week 1. Old genes in a new environment

In this week we will first look at how people used to age in the past. We will share the insights of our 9 years of field work in rural Africa, in the upper east region in Northern Ghana. Next we will look at how different people age in our modern environment, characterised by low levels of physical activity and high levels of calorie-rich food, by chronic stress from our 24-hour economy, and the changed rhythm of wake and sleep that accompanies that. Our modern environment makes us ill.

 
Week 2. The medical reflex and the alternative

And when we become ill, we visit the medical doctor. In what we call the medical reflex, he or she treats the symptoms of our unhealthy lifestyle with medication. This seems like putting the cart before the horse. Why wait till our lifestyle makes us sick and then correct the symptoms with pills instead of fixing the problem, our lifestyle? We will view ageing and age-related diseases as emergencies in slowmotion: Just as deadly, but they take twenty years instead of twenty seconds from the first symptoms to death. This means there is a window of opportunity to steer away. But not by telling people what to do

 
Week 3. From conscious to unconscious health behaviours

For over thirty years we have been told for thirty years that what we should and should not do to remain healthy up to higher ages. The trick is to maintain the healthy behaviour in the long term  by integrating it into daily routine. We have been told what to do, but our bodies don’t want to and never will. We can try to control our body with our brain, by telling it not to eat too much chocolate every day. But this is neither great fun nor very effective, especially in the long run. In this module we consider an alternative: what if these healthy options become easier, maybe even automatic and unconscious? We will review how many of our choices are heavily influenced by the environment even though we like to think of ourselves as rational individuals making conscious decisions.

 
Week 4. Hacking everyday environments

In this module we look at some common environments. We will start with the home environment and review how redesigning our kitchen can change the way we eat. We will study how changes in the bedroom can make us sleep better. Next, we will look at working environments. How can you convert your office into a place from which you gain health instead of one that increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes? And how can the school canteen and office cafeteria be arranged as a place to promote a healthy diet?

 
Week 5. In the neighbourhood, public environments and transits: the case of Copenhagen

In this module, we will look at the neighbourhood and the public environment and transits. How can small changes in the neighbourhood promote social interaction with neighbours? How can a city seduce its inhabitants to use the bike more often than the car? We will take an in depth look into Copenhagen, a city that has dedicated itself to become to cycling capital of the world. They have not told anyone that they should bike more often. Instead they have created an environment in which biking is the most accessible, fun, easiest, cheapest, fun, accessible and fastest way to get from A to B in town.

 
Week 6. A new public health 

In the previous module we studied the case of Copenhagen. When promoting health in a radically different way (i.e.not by building hospitals and employing doctors but by converting a city into a cycling city), large investments have to be made in infrastructure. This requires a holistic view on public health. Health that is not only promoted by doctors and hospitals, which are financed by the ministry of health. Health can also be promoted, for example, the train company that facilitates commuting. Train companies can promote healthy behaviour by providing easy bike-access to platforms and facilities for taking bikes on trains. Although such investments do not pay themselves back directly through increased revenues from train tickets, their substantial health benefits and reduced sick leave benefits create a net positive return on these investments. In this module we consider a new public health, one that emphasizes healthy populations instead of sick individuals.",2-3 hours per week,Health & Safety,Introductory,English

Stochastic Processes: Data Analysis and Computer Simulation,https://www.edx.org/course/stochastic-processes-data-analysis-kyotoux-009x-0,"The course deals with how to simulate and analyze stochastic processes, in particular the dynamics of small particles diffusing in a fluid.","The motion of falling leaves or small particles diffusing in a fluid is highly stochastic in nature. Therefore, such motions must be modeled as stochastic processes, for which exact predictions are no longer possible. This is in stark contrast to the deterministic motion of planets and stars, which can be perfectly predicted using celestial mechanics.
This course is an introduction to stochastic processes through numerical simulations, with a focus on the proper data analysis needed to interpret the results. We will use the Jupyter (iPython) notebook as our programming environment. It is freely available for Windows, Mac, and Linux through the Anaconda Python Distribution.
The students will first learn the basic theories of stochastic processes. Then, they will use these theories to develop their own python codes to perform numerical simulations of small particles diffusing in a fluid. Finally, they will analyze the simulation data according to the theories presented at the beginning of course.
At the end of the course, we will analyze the dynamical data of more complicated systems, such as financial markets or meteorological data, using the basic theory of stochastic processes.","What you'll learn

Contract Law: From Trust to Promise to Contract,https://www.edx.org/course/contract-law-trust-promise-contract-harvardx-hls2x-4,"Contracts are a part of our everyday life, arising in collaboration, trust, promise and credit. How are contracts formed? What makes a contract enforceable? What happens when one party breaks a promise?","Learn about contracts from Harvard Law Professor Charles Fried, one of the world’s leading authorities on contract law. Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation.
We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.
This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.
The course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.","What you'll learn

The Science of Parenting,https://www.edx.org/course/science-parenting-uc-san-diegox-parenting101x,"Move beyond the chatter and opinion surrounding parenting and learn about the scientific findings and data that can help you make sensible, informed parenting decisions.","Everyone has an opinion on parenting – where babies should sleep, what they should eat, and whether parents should spank, scold, or praise. What’s more, the media often offers support for whichever opinions appear most popular at any given time. This leaves those of us who like to base our decisions on firm, provable facts feeling dizzy.


“The Science of Parenting” addresses this confusion by moving beyond the chatter and opinion surrounding parenting, and by looking directly at the science. Parenting itself is far from a science. Nevertheless, scientists have conducted thousands of studies that can help parents – or future parents – make sensible, informed decisions.


One goal of this course will be to provide a survey of important scientific findings spanning a range of topics that are central to the lives of parents: 

diet;
sleep;
discipline;
learning;
screen time;
impulse control;
vaccination.

We’ll also explore ongoing mysteries, like what causes autism, and why so many children are allergic to peanuts.


Perhaps more important, this course will not only dig into existing science, but will also explore the underlying nature of parenting science itself. Often, scientists measure correlations: they ask how different parenting practices are related to different behaviors in children. But the claims they make from correlational data are often much, much stronger. For example, from correlational data, scientists often claim that parents cause the behaviors of their kids. This course will show how this type of error – common in the scientific literature – can explain a significant amount of the confusion present in the media and general public. We will discuss how to avoid the same error when evaluating science, and how to use the sum of available evidence to inform decision making.


The course’s instructor, David Barner, is a leading authority on cognitive development. He is joined by leading experts on behavior genetics, vaccination, autism, lying, and spanking, as well as by real live parents who try to use science to inform their decisions. This class is suitable not only for parents, future parents, and grandparents, but also for professionals interested in health care, social work, and early childhood education who want to increase their knowledge and analysis skills.","What you'll learn

Core knowledge on topics including infant sleep, forms of discipline, breastfeeding, language and math learning, screen time, bilingualism, and autism;
Analytical and applied techniques, including how to compute the contribution of genetics to a trait, how to understand and compute correlations, and how kids can effectively study for tests;
Best practices for sleep training, discipline, and feeding.

"Proteins: Alignment, Analysis and Structure",https://www.edx.org/course/proteins-alignment-analysis-structure-usmx-university-maryland-university-bif002x,Learn about proteins and the important role structure plays in their function as you learn how to analyze and align protein sequences.,"Proteins play a very important role in all organisms. In fact, most of the work that happens inside every cell happens because a specific protein is employed for a specific task. Often the three-dimensional shape of a protein plays a major role in its function. As such, it is important to know the structure of all proteins to have an idea of what function they perform.
One of the jobs of a bioinformatician is to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein using only the DNA sequence that encodes it as well as determining the effects of any mutations in the DNA on the three-dimensional structure/function.
In this course, part of the Bioinformatics MicroMasters program, you will learn about protein structure and its impact on function, practice aligning protein sequences to discover differences, and generate model structures of proteins using web and software-based approaches.","What you'll learn

Since DNA sequences play such an important role in any organism it should not be surprising that any changes to a sequence could lead to alterations in behavior or response. For example, a small number of specific changes in DNA sequence have been shown to lead to tumor development in mammals or the production of enzymes with altered properties.
One of the jobs of a bioinformatician is to help determine where these changes are in a DNA sequence and sort out in that context what effects may result, which is usually done by aligning the sequences in question.
In this course, part of the Bioinformatics MicroMasters program, you will learn about the theory and algorithms behind DNA alignments, practice doing alignments manually, and then perform more complicated alignments using web and software based approaches.","What you'll learn

As a data pro, you know that some scenarios—particularly those involving real-time analytics, site personalization, IoT, and mobile apps—are better addressed with NoSQL storage and compute solutions than they are with relational databases. Microsoft Azure has several NoSQL (or “Not Only SQL”) non-relational data storage options to choose from. NoSQL databases are generally built to be distributed and partitioned across many servers. And they’re built to scale out for high availability and to be flexible enough to handle semi-structured and unstructured data. If you have a data model that is constantly evolving and you want to move fast, that’s what these databases are about.
In this practical course, complete with labs, assessments, and a final exam, join the experts to learn how NoSQL has evolved over time. Explore non-relational data storage options in Azure, and see how to use them in your applications. Find out how to create, store, manage, and access data in these different storage options. Get an in-depth look at Azure Table Storage, DocumentDB, MongoDB, and more. Learn about the “three Vs”—variety (schemas or scenarios that evolve quickly), volume (scale in terms of data storage), and velocity (throughput needs to support a large user base). Take this opportunity to get hands-on with NoSQL options in Azure.","What you'll learn

Developing International Software,https://www.edx.org/course/developing-international-software-microsoft-dis50x-1,Learn how to design and develop software for international use from experts who’ve helped create some of the world’s most successful software.,"This course is part of the Microsoft Professional Program in Entry-Level Software Development.When you’re designing and developing new software, it’s easy to get laser-focused on getting it functional and into the market or deployed as soon as possible. Thus, many engineering teams develop software that supports their native language first, postponing support for other languages until “later,” when they think they will have the bandwidth. In other words, they don’t plan ahead. The problem with this approach, which experienced developers have found out the hard way, is that it sacrifices budget, time, and opportunity.
Redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every language or market can be a colossal effort. As this computer science course will demonstrate, planning ahead is far more efficient, and the marginal cost of supporting multiple languages from the get go is less than you may think. Harnessing international functionality in operating systems and programming languages makes writing code that works for multiple languages and markets much simpler than retrofitting existing code.
The instructors for this course include programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world’s most successful software. They’ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they’re here to ensure your software’s user experience works consistently, regardless of where users are from or what languages they speak.
This course has three parts: the business case, world-ready design, and world-ready development. While students can complete parts one and two without programming knowledge, part three requires programming experience.","What you'll learn

Workers expect consistent access to corporate tools and data regardless of the type of device they’re using. They also want their corporate-issued technology and resources to look and behave like their personal technology—always on and always available from any device, from virtually anywhere.
An enterprise model that supports the use of consumer devices in the workplace and the ability to work from virtually anywhere and anytime must move from a device-focused view of IT management to one that’s people centric. In reality it is not the device that is mobile, it is the users.
It is important that the IT challenges of BYOD, Mobile device management, cloud computing, and hybrid identities be understood before one can understand how Windows 10 helps address those issues.","What you'll learn

Shylock’s Bond,https://www.edx.org/course/shylocks-bond-harvardx-hum3-2x,An exploration of the magnetic and ambivalent character of Shylock in William Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.,"Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt (John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities) guides learners through an exploration of Shakespeare’s unforgettable character Shylock in The Merchant of Venice and his historical origins.
In the first act of William Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, the Jewish moneylender Shylock proposes a “merry sport” to the merchant Antonio: he will lend Antonio the money he needs if Antonio agrees to let Shylock take a pound of his flesh should he default. Shylock calls this contract a “merry bond,” and Shakespeare’s First Folio calls the play a comedy. But what does Shylock want from the bond, and how merry does the play ultimately prove? 
This course introduces learners to Jewish history both in Venice and in England, to the ways in which Shakespeare’s own audience might have responded to the play and its genre, and to the history of the play’s production through the twenty-first century. 
Learners will also be invited to share their own theatrical interpretations of The Merchant of Venice and to ask how the meaning of a work of art may change in different times, contexts, and cultures.

In this lab-based computer science course, explore the complexities of embedded systems and learn how to develop your own real-time operating system (RTOS) by building a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity (BLE). An operating system (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS. However, as embedded systems have evolved, so have their complexities. To manage this, an RTOS is now required.
Embedded systems are often deployed in safety-critical situations such as automotive, military, industrial, and medical applications. In applications such as communications and consumer electronics, response time and processing speed are important. A real-time system not only needs to arrive at the correct answer, but must also get the correct answer at the correct time. A RTOS manages a computer's resources so that tasks are performed in a timely mannner.
In this computer science course, students will learn the design fundamentals of an RTOS from the bottom up and use these fundamentals to build practical real-time applications. We will provide a board support package (BSP), so students will be able to focus on the RTOS and Bluetooth network without needing prior experience in circuits and I/O device driver software. This is a hands-on project-based lab course, where you will incrementally build a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity.
This course is intended for students and professional engineers wishing to improve their skills in the fields of embedded systems, product development, computer architecture, operating systems, and Bluetooth networks.
To complete this course, you will need to purchase a lab kit including a microcontroller board, an I/O board, and a Bluetooth module. Instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software are at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/RTOS.html .","What you'll learn

Advanced Biobased Conversion,https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-biobased-conversion-wageningenx-bb04x,"Design new (bio)catalytic conversion routes to use biobased feedstocks to their highest potential as building blocks for chemicals, materials and fuels.","Biomass is the only renewable feedstock which contains the carbon atoms needed to make the molecules to create chemicals, materials and fuels. However, the majority of our current scientific and industrial knowledge on conversion is based on processing fossil feedstocks. In this course we explore the relevant fundamental knowledge on (bio)catalytic conversion in order to produce (new) biobased building blocks, chemicals and products.
The design of an effective (catalytic) process for the conversions of biobased feedstocks to desired products is the core of this course. Unique for bioconversion is the presence of the elements O,N, P, S and the large quantities of water.
We therefore will explore:

microbial, biochemical and chemical (i.e., catalytic) conversion routes.
how to use catalysts, either heterogeneous, homogeneous or biocatalysts function in order to optimize the process of conversion. We discuss how these catalysts can be tuned and their specific advantages and disadvantages for biobased conversions.
the influence of the reactor choice as an inevitable asset in the process. We discuss how to describe the productivity of catalytic processes depending on the choice of the reactor and how the choice of the reactor can add to the stability of the conversion process.

The knowledge you gain allows you to design processes specifically targeted on biomass based conversions as well offering an opportunity to interact with chemist, engineers and scientists who mainly focus on the traditional fossil based conversions.","What you'll learn

Skip Syllabus Description
Week 1: Introduction

This first week we are setting the scene for the global food situation today and projected demand and supply options tomorrow. Covering the four pillars of global food systems, we will zoom in on availability issues, and more in particular on crop production, as central theme of this course. Photosynthesis plays a key role in this process, turning solar light into food, which fuels mankind. Analogously to physical principles applied in building houses, you’ll be acquainted to the bio-physical principles in growing crops.

 
Week 2: Potential production

Potential production is the simplest representation of crop growth, defined by the crop's genetic potential and the ambient growth factors radiation, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration in the air. Under perfect crop management, with no limitation of water and nutrients, and a weed, pathogen and pest free environment, crops reach their potential production.


This week focuses on the conversion of carbon dioxide into plant biomass as powered by solar radiation, with temperature as modifying factor. Based on variation in solar radiation and temperature around the globe, you’ll be able to calculate potential crop yields for different locations.

 
Week 3: Water limited production

In the process of fixing carbon dioxide from the air into biomass, crops inevitably lose water by transpiration. When transpired water from the leaf surface is not adequately replenished through water uptake by the roots, crop production becomes water-limited, resulting in lower yields.


Accounting for the evaporative demand of the air and water availability to the crop, water-limited production can be assessed. Conversely, to reach potential yield, you may determine the amount of water required through irrigation, as a yield increasing measure.

 
Week 4: Nutrient limited production

In addition to water, nutrients are essential to crop production to support physiological processes, like photosynthesis. Various nutrients are absorbed from the soil by the roots. When nutrient availability falls short, production becomes nutrient-limited. In that situation nutrient application by manure or artificial fertilizers is a yield increasing measure..

 
Week 5: Actual production

Actual crop production refers a situation where production is further reduced by effects of weed, pests (insects, mites, nematodes, rodents, and birds), diseases (fungi, bacteria, viruses) and/or pollutants. This introduces an extra level of complexity in plant production.


In spite of intensive crop protection measures in some parts of the world, the actual production is the common production situation for the majority of the world's agricultural production systems. We will look at how weeds, and pests and diseases affect crop yields and what measures can be taken to prevent losses.

 
Week 6: Synthesis

Having tackled the three distinguished production situations separately in the previous weeks, we now come back to complete the diagram reflecting the 'principles of production ecology'. Hopefully, it means more to you now and you can use it in analysing the impact of genetics, environment and management on crop yields, as will be discussed in this synopsis.",6-8 hours per week,Environmental Studies,Intermediate,English
Sustainable Food Security: The value of systems thinking,https://www.edx.org/course/sustainable-food-security-value-systems-wageningenx-ffesx,Learn how to solve the ‘Rubik’s cube’ of systems thinking and how it’s applied to improve the environmental sustainability of food production systems!,"Systems thinking and environmental sustainability: solve the Rubik’s cube
Have you ever considered how many aspects of food production affect the natural environment? Every aspect needs to be considered in attaining the future goal to produce enough food for the growing population while at the same time preserving our planet. It’s as difficult as solving a Rubik’s cube; changing one aspect may affect the environment in a major way.
Systems theory, or systems thinking, is a way of understanding and working with the complexity of sustainable food production systems, which requires training in different disciplines and an approach that can address this complexity. This environmental studies course enables participants to apply the principles of a systems approach to food production with a focus on environmental sustainability.

But it also relates to what international organizations do and, increasingly, it concerns individuals, corporations, NGO’s and other non-state actors.
As the world becomes more interdependent and more complex, and as new institutions are put in place to make international law more effective, international law has become an exciting, expanding field. Never before has it been so relied upon, used and developed. Despite their differences in size, power, culture, religion and ideologies, states rely on international law to cooperate and to coexist; they speak the language of international law and international law serves them as an important common language.
This law course will extensively rely on judgments and advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN).
Having acquired a basic knowledge of international law, you’ll find it easier to comprehend this subject in future international law sub-fields, like international human rights, international humanitarian law or international investment law.
This course will teach you what international law is, the role it plays in the world today, how it can be used. You will also gain knowledge to help you better discern legal arguments within the flow of international news and reports.

According to IBM, every day we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data — so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years. This data comes from everywhere: sensors used to gather climate information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos, purchase transaction records, and cell phone GPS signals, just to name a few. This data is big data.
The demand for storing this unprecedented amount of information is enough of a challenge, but when you add the need for analytics, the technology requirements truly start pushing the envelope on state-of-the-art IT infrastructures. Fortunately, the Open Source community has stepped up to this challenge and developed a storage and processing layer called Apache Hadoop. Add the dozens of other projects integrating with Apache Hadoop and you have the whole Hadoop ecosystem.
The Hadoop ecosystem, along with the data management architectures it enables, is growing at an unprecedented rate, with 73% of Hadoop cluster deployments now in production — a number which continues to rise.
The demand for individuals who have experience managing this platform is also accelerating. According to the IT Skills and Certifications Pay Index research from Foote Partners, “the need for big data skills also continues to lead to pay increases — about 8% over the last year.” Now is exactly the right time to build an exciting and rewarding career managing big data with Apache Hadoop.
This introductory course is taught by Hadoop experts from The Linux Foundation’s ODPi collaborative project. As host to some of the world's leading open source projects, The Linux Foundation provides training and networking opportunities to help you advance your career.

Overview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)
Transformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)
OpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)
Raytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)

This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.

FAQ
What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. 
Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.
Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.
Will the text of the lectures be available?
Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.
Do I need to watch the lectures live?
No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can ""work ahead"" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.
How much does it cost to take the course?
Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.
What computer system do I need for the course?
The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.
Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?
This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.
Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?
Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.
I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?
In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.
I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?
The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.","What you'll learn

We start by identifying the personalities and historical forces—the progressives, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining—that shaped and re-shaped U.S. school politics and policy. We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.
From there, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools—be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches to education reform.","What you'll learn

Week 1: Microbalances in Transport Phenomena

A short summary of microbalances in tubular reactors (plug flow), with in parallel the introduction of the ‘microbalance’ for subjects which were not covered in TP101x Transport Phenomena, such as Fourier and Fick's law in different geometries (diffusion through membranes). 

Week 2: The momentum balance

The momentum balance is a new subject and can be combined with mass and energy balance.
Introduction of the pressure drop by means of a force balance and the definition of the friction factor for tubes, bends and other pipe connections. A link can be made to the mechanical energy balance. 

Week 3: Convection: Mass and Heat transport

Convective transport is much more powerful than diffusion. It is also much more complex and in most cases can only be treated using (dimensionless) correlations for the transfer coefficients.
Along with convective heat transfer the analogy is introduced with mass transfer.

You will learn how TypeScript has solved many issues developers have suffered from with JavaScript. You will learn how TypeScript has made web development more fun and easier. You will be doing all this using the most recent released version of the language TypeScript 2.3.
This course will cover all you need to know to get up and running and start building functional websites using TypeScript 2.3
We assume that you have a general understanding of either JavaScript or another programming language. This course will not teach you JavaScript or the fundamentals of programming so if you haven't programmed before, be sure to set aside extra time so you can explore some basic concepts and skills that may be foreign to you. Object Oriented Programming (OOP ) experience is not required but is a big plus to understand concepts like classes and inheritance in TypeScript. Familiarity with HTML is also very helpful for this course.
If you are familiar with JavaScript, many of the concepts in TypeScript will be familiar but we'll cover some concepts that may be new to you and show you how TypeScript can enhance your JavaScript programming.
Knowing TypeScript is becoming more and more a must have skill for web development since many of the web development libraries now are using TypeScript. For example, TypeScript is a must when it comes to using Angular 2 in a web application. TypeScript also can be used in server-side applications. Knowing TypeScript is your way to become a full stack developer.

Making Sense of Climate Science Denial,https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x-4,"Climate change is real, so why the controversy and debate? Learn to make sense of the science and to respond to climate change denial.","In public discussions, climate change is a highly controversial topic. However, in the scientific community, there is little controversy with 97% of climate scientists concluding humans are causing global warming.

Why the gap between the public and scientists?
What are the psychological and social drivers of the rejection of the scientific consensus?
How has climate denial influenced public perceptions and attitudes towards climate change?

This course examines the science of climate science denial.
We will look at the most common climate myths from “global warming stopped in 1998” to “global warming is caused by the sun” to “climate impacts are nothing to worry about.”
We’ll find out what lessons are to be learnt from past climate change as well as better understand how climate models predict future climate impacts. You’ll learn both the science of climate change and the techniques used to distort the science.
With every myth we debunk, you’ll learn the critical thinking needed to identify the fallacies associated with the myth. Finally, armed with all this knowledge, you’ll learn the psychology of misinformation. This will equip you to effectively respond to climate misinformation and debunk myths.
This isn’t just a climate MOOC; it’s a MOOC about how people think about climate change.","What you'll learn

We’ll focus on five topics in this course:
1. Introduction to Biobased Sciences
Learn about the products that can be derived from biomass and the processes used to do so, compared to current fossil based products and processes.
2. Biorefinery
Biorefinery deals with the challenge of extracting valuable biomass components and converting them to final products. To achieve this you first need knowledge of the different types of biomass, the molecules present and their chemical characteristics. Biorefinery is all about efficient processing. Aspects of processing include the harvesting, pre-treatments, conversion and separation technologies.
3. Consumer Behaviour
Understand the challenges of moving towards a biobased economy and gaining consumer acceptance. How do consumers evaluate products? And how is their perception influenced by communication strategies?  Understanding the basics of consumer science will help you to implement a consumer view when developing a product. 
4. Biomass production
A biobased economy runs on biomass. It is therefore important to understand which factors play a major role in crop growth, yield formation and quality. In this module you’ll learn to identify design criteria for the production of biobased crops on both a crop and farm level.
5. Achieving Sustainability
Delve into the true meaning of sustainability and how sustainability issues are linked to human activities. Biobased products are not always as sustainable as it seems on first glance. You’ll learn that an understanding of the degree of sustainability requires a thorough analysis of a variety of factors and constituents.","What you'll learn
Students will be able to:  

Understand the concept and importance of the biobased economy and the value of biobased products.
Understand the factors and methods that can influence production of biobased crops;
Understand how the composition and chemical nature of biomass fractions determines the processing steps within a biorefinery;

Ecodesign for Cities and Suburbs,https://www.edx.org/course/ecodesign-cities-suburbs-ubcx-ecodesignx-0,"Using real examples, learn how ecology can guide urban design to avert environmental disasters and improve people’s lives.","Too often modern cities and suburbs are disorganized places where most new development makes daily life less pleasant, creates more traffic congestion, and contributes to climate change. This trend has to change; and our course is going to show you how.
Ecodesign means integrating planning, urban design and the conservation of natural systems to produce a sustainable built and natural environment. Ecodesign can be implemented through normal business practices and the kinds of capital programs and regulations already in use in most communities. We will show you how ecodesign has already been used for exceptional projects in many cities and suburbs—from Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm to False Creek North in Vancouver to Battery Park City in Manhattan, as well as many smaller-scale examples that can be adopted in any community. Cities and suburbs built according to ecodesign principles can and should become normal, instead of just a few special examples, transforming urban development into desirable, lower-carbon, compact and walkable communities and business centers.
As this course describes specific solutions to the vexing urban challenges we all face, course participants can see how these ideas might be applied in their own area. Participants will learn the conceptual framework of ecodesign, see many real, successful examples, and come to understand the tools, processes, and techniques for policy development and implementation.
Ecodesign thinking is relevant to anyone who has a part in shaping or influencing the future of cities and suburbs – citizens, students, designers, public officials, and politicians. At the conclusion of the course participants will have the tools and strategies necessary to advocate policies and projects for a neighbourhood or urban district using the ecodesign framework.","What you'll learn

With this in mind, it is no surprise that one fourth of the CEOs of the world’s 100 largest corporations have an engineering degree.
Solving these global problems requires leaders who, in the first place, are comfortable with technology, models and quantitative analyses -- Leaders who see systems instead of isolated problems. However, simply understanding technology is not enough. Successful leaders today must have both the ideas and the know-how to put these ideas into action by working collaboratively with others, winning their hearts and minds.
We need leaders who know how to seize opportunities in a networked world, and can mobilize people and other stakeholders for large-scale change. Leaders who lead fulfilling lives and who are able to move themselves and others from the ‘me’ to the ‘we’. Leaders who are long-term oriented and who deliver economic profit, while also making positive contributions to society and the environment. We call these leaders ‘sustainable leaders’.
This course has three parts:

 In the first part, you will explore the context that leaders are facing, building an understanding of the complexities of global and business challenges. You will discover the ambiguities and the many stakeholders that leaders must consider when making their choices. You will get a sense of effective leadership practices.
In the second part, you will discover your “who am I” through personal and group exercises. You will create a “Personal Charter” that can serve as a life-long guide, helping you, as a leader, to make important choices in your personal and professional life.
In the third part, we will bring the knowledge of the context and yourself together. We will translate the insights of this course into a leadership model and you will discover what sustainable leaders do. We will offer you frameworks to help you make your own career choices. We will finally help you to ‘sell’ yourself as a leader.

Unfortunately, recent events have shown that this phenomenon is becoming increasingly complex, especially with respect to some legal issues, for instance relating to:

The definition of combatants when terrorists are involved in the hostilities.
The detention by rebels of State armed forces.
The involvement and status of UN peacekeepers involved in combat operations.

This law course will help you understand these complex legal issues by teaching you basic norms governing armed conflicts, also known as ‘International Humanitarian Law’ (‘IHL’).

Who and what can be targeted by the enemy?
Which method of warfare is authorized?
Who enjoys what type of protection?
Which norms apply in non-international armed conflicts?

 We will address these critical issues in light of recent practice, including the fight against ISIS and Al-Qaeda in different regions of the world, as well as other recent conflicts such as those in Armenia, Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, etc. We will also cover older conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian one. In this course, you can choose between an audit (free) track and a verified track ($150 fee). The audit track

Circular Economy,https://www.edx.org/course/circular-economy-wageningenx-bb05x,"Join the transition towards a circular economy considering economic, supply chain, social, technical, managerial and environmental aspects.","Do you want to contribute to a more sustainable society? Tackle the challenges in the transition towards a circular economy? In this course you will analyse what it takes to create a circular economy including sustainable supply chains.
Circular economy challenge 
The transition towards a circular economy is one of the biggest challenges in order to create a more sustainable society. This transition requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining socio-technical, managerial, and environmental considerations.
Valuable resources often end up as waste. We challenge you to find and analyse examples of this in your own environment. You could consider possible solutions to reduce or recycle waste, but you soon realise that waste is not the only problem. Precious materials such as copper, gold and phosphorus are gradually disappearing. Water is becoming scarce, pollution of water and air is massive and a lot of food is thrown away.
Right now we design products from cradle to grave: from production to consumption to waste, which is a linear model. But we should design products from cradle to cradle: in a closed loop whereby they don’t become waste, but valuable resources again. And when we start thinking in circles, we might as well try to reinvent not just supply chains, but entire systems.
Because that’s what we have been doing with sustainability: we have been departing from the status quo, while cradle to cradle and circular pushes us to think outside the box.
Conventional understanding of sustainability proposes activities defined in terms of decreasing and reducing, such as ‘zero footprint’, ‘zero waste’, reduction of pollution, reduction of energy consumption. The focus is on reducing negative impacts. We call this eco-efficiency, which is often seen as a goal in itself – we can keep doing what we do, just strive to do it less.
Cradle to Cradle celebrates abundance; it recognises that people, just like ants and trees, are abundant and have a large impact on their environment. The challenge is to make this impact a positive one and we invite you to join this challenge!
Systems approach to circular economy 
In this course, we therefore take a systems approach to the circular economy, considering different stakeholder perspectives, their incentive structures, and their impacts on circular alternatives.
The circular solutions will be identified by technological assessment using applied as well as emerging technologies. Since identifying and evaluating potential circular alternatives based on quantitative techniques is key in achieving sustainable solutions, you will also learn how to use life cycle assessment and agent-based modelling to assess the socio-technical and manageable challenges and environmental benefits of alternative solutions.
By integrating all perspectives in a case study, you will learn how to comprehensively and critically assess strategies to transition towards a circular economy.","What you'll learn

Understand how a circular economy deviates from the current linear system

This law course includes interviews with individuals who have used surrogacy and sperm donation, with medical professionals who are experts in current reproductive technologies like In Vitro Fertilization and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, and bioethicists and journalists who study the ownership and use of genetic information within human tissue. Additional Harvard colleagues will also share with you their thoughts on topics such as disability law as it relates to reproductive technology.
While the law and ethics surrounding these technologies are a central component to this course, we also show you examples of the deeply personal and human side of these issues. Throughout the course, and with the help of law students, we will discuss leading legal cases in this field, which will illuminate the types of questions the law has struggled with – stretching and evolving over time. From the famous Baby M surrogacy case, to cases on the paternity of sperm donors, to a case related to the ownership of human tissue turned into a commercial product, and others. We will show you the ethical, legal, and rhetorical underpinnings, which have served as the basis for various court decisions over the past 20 or 30 years. We will also explore potential future technologies and their implications for society: genetic enhancements to increase our intelligence, let us live a hundred years longer, or make us immune to diseases – and the possibility of creating animal-human hybrids, for example a mouse with a humanized brain.
The content within this course is intended to be instructive, and show how legal reasoning has been applied, or could be applied, to questions related to parenthood, reproduction, and other issues surrounding human genetic material. The material organized within this course should be considered an authoritative overview, but is not intended to serve as medical or legal advice.","What you'll learn

Framing: How Politicians Debate,https://www.edx.org/course/framing-how-politicians-debate-delftx-frame101x-0,The game of framing and reframing. Analyze how politicians debate and what the underlying patterns are in the game of framing and reframing.,"Is a good, solid argument enough to make an impact? How would you disprove the stance that man-made global warming is just an “opinion”? How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues?  No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message.
In today’s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners’ values and emotions – it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively.
When you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents – and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media – even at home.
We invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself. 
This course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates. Not only people from the public sector will find it useful, but also engineers, consultants, managers and anyone who wants to make an impact in discussions and debates.

Desde que en 1954 se realizara el primer trasplante exitoso de un órgano, la cirugía de trasplantes se ha desarrollado espectacularmente brindando esperanza y calidad de vida a muchos enfermos. Mientras esas técnicas y posibilidades terapéuticas avanzan, persisten sin embargo muchos interrogantes sobre el modo en el que los órganos pueden obtenerse lícitamente. Algunos de esos dilemas nos acompañan desde siempre, otros son suscitados por la aparición de fenómenos novedosos como el turismo de trasplantes, las posibilidades que ofrece la donación tras la muerte cardiocirculatoria o los descubrimientos sobre las funciones fisiológicas remanentes en los pacientes diagnosticados en muerte cerebral. En la inmensa mayoría de los países no se pueden comprar y vender órganos. ¿Por qué? A pesar de que muchas personas siguen muriendo a la espera de recibir un órgano, en ningún país se confiscan los órganos de las personas fallecidas. ¿Por qué? ¿Pueden donar los menores? ¿Debemos prescindir de la conocida como “regla del donante cadáver” y permitir la eutanasia para la donación? ¿Con qué límites? ¿De qué manera influye la potencial condición de donante de un órgano en los cuidados que se proporcionan al final de la vida? ¿Cómo evitar el conflicto de intereses entre quienes velan por la vida de los futuros receptores de un órgano y quienes aún se afanan por cuidar a quien va a fallecer de manera irremisible e inminente?


En este curso nos adentraremos en el análisis de ésas y otras cuestiones, pero también introduciremos los nuevos desafíos que para la ética y el Derecho plantean trasplantes novedosos así como la discusión en torno a los criterios de justa distribución de los órganos

 
The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs.","What you'll learn

The Architectural Imagination,https://www.edx.org/course/architectural-imagination-harvardx-gsd1x,Learn fundamental principles of architecture — as an academic subject or a professional career — from a study of history’s important buildings.,"Architecture engages a culture’s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. In this course, you will learn how to “read” architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian.
Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we’ll examine some of history’s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture’s complex aspirations.
The first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination—perspective drawing and architectural typology—are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history.
In the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture’s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction—glass and steel, reinforced concrete—are crucial agents of change. But a society’s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture’s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture.
The final set of modules confronts architecture’s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. As a professional practice deeply embedded in society, architecture has social obligations and the aesthetic power to negotiate social change; to carry collective memories; even to express society’s utopian ideals. You will learn about what we call architecture’s power of representation, and see how architecture has a particular capacity to produce collective meaning and memories.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.  
By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.  
Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.  
Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course.

Framing the problem (Ask);
Gathering evidence (Acquire);
Evaluating evidence (Appraise);
Synthesizing findings (Aggregate);
Implementation (Apply)
Evaluating the outcomes (Assess).

Graduate business education has come under fire in recent years for not adequately preparing students for the challenge of managing in a complex, information-rich, and rapidly changing commercial environment. This was clearly demonstrated during the global financial crisis which exposed the inability of graduates from leading business schools to adapt what they had learnt to this new reality.
Evidence-based practice in management is a response to this situation. This business course focuses on exposing students to the latest academic thinking, while also equipping students to be critical and analytical thinkers that challenge established beliefs, and utilize the best available evidence to inform ethical decision making. Learn the EBM framework, how to analyze research, use critical thinking and more to make better business decisions.
The knowledge and skills developed in this course will prepare students to confront future business challenges. These business and management capabilities are critical for emerging leaders, established managers, and entrepreneurs.
This course provides the foundation for all other courses in the Evidence-Based Management MicroMasters Program.","What you'll learn
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
Identify problems that require decision-making based on knowledge of research fundamentals and EBP principles and competencies.
Establish the search strategy to acquire the best available evidence relevant to the problem.
Ascertain the appropriate methodology relevant to questions and the reliability and validity of evidence.
Integrate all types of relevant evidence towards finding solutions to the problem.
Generate and implement best solutions to the problem with due consideration of their social and ethical implications.
Evaluate feedback obtained on applied solutions for necessary adjustment.

Economic Democracy: The Cooperative Alternative,https://www.edx.org/course/economic-democracy-cooperative-edinburghx-coopsx,"Could a cooperative market economy, in which firms are owned and controlled by their workers, be a viable and efficient alternative to capitalism?","What would happen if workers ran their own businesses? Would worker-managed firms make the same decisions as their capitalist counterparts? Could such an economy be efficient? What policies could be deployed to promote a cooperative sector?
This course will focus on these central questions as we discuss the internal impact of employee ownership; productivity, governance and management, as well as the external impact of employee ownership; spillovers for health, democracy, and the local economy.
We will also discuss the simple economic theory of the labour-managed firm. Cooperatives have many attractive features, including high productivity. But they account for a relatively small proportion of GDP in most economies. We analyse possible reasons for this apparent paradox. There is widespread interest around the world in cooperatives as an alternative to the capitalist corporation, particularly since the financial crash of 2008. Economics and other social sciences sharpen the debate on cooperatives. After taking this course, you will be better prepared to participate in public discussion on cooperatives, join a cooperative, or even start a new one.
This course was created in collaboration with the following institutions:","What you'll learn
Basic economics of firms owned or controlled by their workers
The main issues relating to the long-term viability of cooperatives
Policies to promote a cooperative sector in a market economy

""The form of association ... which if mankind continue to improve, must be expect­ed in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist with capitalist as chief, and workpeople without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.”

- John Stuart Mill, Principles of Political Economy, 1848
